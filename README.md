## Individual Semester Project in Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computing (AI Master's Degree Program) : Solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem using an Evolutionary Algorithm

The traveling salesperson problem consists of minimizing the length of a cycle that visits all vertices (ex. cities) in a
weighted, directed graph.   
The length of a cycle is defined as the sum of the weights of all directed edges constituting the cycle (ex. distances between cities).

In this project, the distances between N cities are stored in a (N x N) matrix.
To test the algorithm, 4 .csv files
