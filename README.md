Individual Semester Project in Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computing (AI Master's Degree Program) : Solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem using an Evolutionary Algorithm

The traveling salesperson problem consists of minimizing the length of a cycle that visits all vertices in a
weighted, directed graph. The length of a cycle is defined as the sum of the weights of all directed edges constituting the cycle.
